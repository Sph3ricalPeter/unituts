      <h1>Creating your first game</h1>
      <p>
        It's time to make our first game. Unfortunately, I'm here to tell you
        that it's not an open world massively multiplayer online survival
        roleplaying game. Instead, we're going to make an autoclicker. Know
        that game called Cookie Clicker? Yeah ... We're going to make
        something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is, everyone has to start somewhere and the things you
        learn here will kick off your journey into game development. Let's get
        started!
      </p>
      <h4>Creating a project</h4>
      <p>
        We will start by opening Unity Hub and creating a new project. Unity
        version doesn't matter too much, so just pick whatever is suggested to
        you.
      </p>

      <h4>Setting default code editor</h4>
      <p>
        Once the project is created, you will see the default Unity editor UI.
        It's easy to get overwhelmed, but hang in there ... We will only be
        working with the following panels for now: the Scene, the Game view,
        the Inspector, the Hierarchy panel, the Project panel and the Console.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we do anything, it will be useful to tell Unity to use VS Code
        as the go-to code editor.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>go to the top navigation of the editor window</li>
        <li>select "Edit"</li>
        <li>select "Preferences"</li>
        <li>in the preferences window, go to "External Tools"</li>
        <li>
          in the external code editor, select "VS Code" from the dropdown
        </li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/articles/fg_preferences.png" alt="Selecting VS Code as the external script editor" />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        To test our changes, we will go to the Project panel, rightclick the
        Assets folder and create a new C# script. Unity will create a new
        script file in the C# language, which we will use to make our
        clicker game. You can name this file "MyClicker". To open it,
        simple double click it. The file should open in VS Code.
      </p>

      <h4>Writing our first game loop</h4>
      <p>
        We will begin writing our game. In the file we just opened, you can
        see 2 blocks of code - Start and Update. These are called methods.
        They are part a class named after the file it's defined in.
      </p>
      <h4>Start</h4>
      <p>
        Start is a method, which is called when the game starts. This means
        that the code we write here will only happen once. We will begin by
        creating a variable, which will track our clicks. We will name it
        "counter". In the start method, we will set its value to 0.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/articles/fg_newVariable.png" alt="New 'counter' variable being set in the Start method" />

      </figure>
      <h4>Update</h4>
      <p>
        The Update method is called every frame. This can be used to do
        something repeatedly. We will use the Update method to check for
        player input. If the player clicks the left mouse button, we will
        increment the counter. To display that the counter updated, we will
        use the console. Unity provides a simple way to log to the console via
        the <code>Debug.Log()</code> method.
      </p>

      <h4>Using our script</h4>
      <p>
        We should now have a working script. To test it out, we need to attach
        it to a Unity game object. We can do this in the Hierarchy panel.
        Create a new GameObject with a right click. Select it and you will see
        its properties in the Inspector panel. Drag and drop our script from
        the Project panel into the inspector. The script should be added to
        the object.
      </p>

      <h4>Playtesting our game</h4>
      <p>
        To play the game, simply click the play button at the top of the
        editor view. Once the game loads, the play button will be colored
        blue. Now if you click with the left mouse button, a message in the
        console should appear with an incremented counter.
      </p>

        That's it! You made it! If you'd like to continue on your gamedev
        journey, I have some <a href="suggestions.html">tips</a> for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If not, don't worry. Game dev isn't for everyone. Good job for making it
        this far! <b>You rock!</b>
