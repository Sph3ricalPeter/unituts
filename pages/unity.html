        <h3>What is unity</h3>
        <p>
          Unity is a popular tool allowing developers to create games from
          scratch, using various assets, some of which are available
          for free on the Unity Asset Store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unity is, IMHO, a good starting point for anyone looking to dabble in
          game development for the first time. Unity is by no means the only
          option on the market. Engines like Godot or Game Maker may be easier
          to understand at first, but I find Unity to be right in the middle in
          terms of ease of use and customizaiblity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some incredible games are built with Unity, such as Escape from
          Tarkov, Cuphead or Hollow Knight.
