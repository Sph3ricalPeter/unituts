      <h1>What is unity</h1>
      <p>
        Unity is a popular tool allowing developers to create games from
        scratch, using various assets, some of which are available for free on
        the Unity Asset Store.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unity is, IMHO, a good starting point for anyone looking to dabble in
        game development for the first time. Unity is by no means the only
        option on the market. Engines like Godot or Game Maker may be easier
        to understand at first, but I find Unity to be right in the middle in
        terms of ease of use and customizaiblity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some incredible games are built with Unity, such as

        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/261570/Ori_and_the_Blind_Forest/" target="_blank">Ori and the Blind
          Forest</a>
        or
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/" target="_blank">Hollow Knight</a>.
