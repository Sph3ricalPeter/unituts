        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>
          In this article, I will try to get staight to the point of making
          games. But first, there are a couple things we need to set up.
        </p>
        <h4>Installation</h4>
        <p>
          Obviously, we need to install Unity itself. You can do that from the
          <a href="https://unity.com/download">official site</a>. I recommend
          installing the suggested Unity Hub, which helps you to keep track of
          projects and different versions of Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make games, we will also need to <code>code</code>. If you've never
          coded anything before - don't worry. We will go through the basics in
          the <a href="firstgame.html">following article</a>. You will, however,
          need an editor to write the code in. For this I strongly recommend
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>. It's a
          lightweight text editor with the option to turn it into a powerful
          development environment, which helps you with syntax and many other
          things.
