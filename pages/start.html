      <h1>Getting started</h1>
      <p>
        In this article, we will setup everything we need to start making games.
      </p>
      <h4>Installation</h4>
      <p>
        Obviously, we need to install Unity itself. You can do that from the
        <a href="https://unity.com/download" target="_blank">official site</a>. I recommend installing the suggested
        Unity Hub, which helps you to
        keep track of projects and different versions of Unity.

        To make games, we will also need to <code>code</code>. If you've never
        coded anything before - don't worry. We will go through everything step-by-step in
        the <a href="firstgame.html">following article</a>. You will, however,
        need an editor to write the code in. For this I strongly recommend
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>.
        It's a lightweight text editor with the option to turn it into a
        powerful development environment, which helps you with syntax and many
        other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have VS Code installed I also recommend to get the C#
        extension along with a
        <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472" target="_blank">.NET core 4.7.2
          pack</a>
        from Microsoft. These two paired together will make sure writing code
        in Unity will be pretty much as good as it gets. If you need some extra help, you can follow <a
          href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp" target="_blank">this article</a>.
